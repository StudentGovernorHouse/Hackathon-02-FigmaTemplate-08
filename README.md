# 🎨 UI/UX Hackathon-02-FigmaTemplate-08 - GIAIC 2024 🖥️

## 🚀 About This Project

This project was created as part of Hackathon 2 from the Governor IT Initiative Challenge (GIAIC). The challenge was to develop a pixel-perfect, responsive UI/UX based on the design provided in Figma. The website features a complete e-commerce platform with components such as a landing page, product listings, wishlist, and cart functionalities.

I took the Figma design provided by the hackathon organizers and translated it into code using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. The design is fully responsive, ensuring that the website functions smoothly on all device sizes
